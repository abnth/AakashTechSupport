This document is intended for both the stakeholders and the developers of the system .The features discussed in this document are mainly functional requirements. These requirements are described in software development perspective to easily grasp by use. It also covers the non-functional requirements like performance, reliability, availability, security and maintainability.

Project Scope
-------------

With the continued evolution in technology, portal is becoming more and more essential now-a-days, where user can freely express their thoughts, ideas and discuss their issues that they are currently facing with the technologies and products they use.Aakash tech support portal provides a convenient and easy-to-use graphical user interface for the users.

Setting up the server into server mode requires that there will be open ports for accepting connections from the clients. The connection between the client and the server uses Connection oriented communication, via TCP/IP—Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, implements reliable delivery of messages. Connection-oriented communication makes programming easier because the protocol includes mechanisms for detecting and handling errors and an acknowledgment mechanism between client and service.

   :align: center


Non Functional Requirements 
===========================

Performance Requirements
------------------------

- Performance

The system must be interactive and the delays involved must be less .So in every action-response of the system, there are no immediate delays. In case of opening windows forms, of popping error messages and saving the settings or sessions there is delay much below 2 seconds, In case of opening databases, sorting questions and evaluation there are no delays and the operation is performed in less than 2 seconds for opening ,sorting, computing, posting > 95% of the files. Also when connecting to the server the delay is based editing on the distance of the 2 systems and the configuration between them so there is high probability that there will be or not a successful connection in less than 20 seconds for sake of good communication.


- Safety

Information transmission should be securely transmitted to server without any changes in information


- Reliability

As the system provide the right tools for discussion, problem solving it must be made sure that the system is reliable in its operations and for securing the sensitive details.


Software Quality Attributes
---------------------------

- Availability

If the internet service gets disrupted while sending information to the server, the information can be send again for verification.


- Security

The main security concern is for users account hence proper login mechanism should be used to avoid hacking. The tablet id registration is way to spam check for increasing the security. Hence, security is provided from unwanted use of recognition software.

- Usability

As the system is easy to handle and navigates in the most expected way with no delays. In that case the system program reacts accordingly and transverses quickly between its states.
